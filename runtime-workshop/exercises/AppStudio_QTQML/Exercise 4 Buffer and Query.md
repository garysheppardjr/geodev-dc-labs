# Exercise 4: Buffer a Point and Query Features (AppStudio)

This exercise walks you through the following:
- Get the user to click a point
- Display the clicked point and a buffer around it
- Query for features within the buffer

Prerequisites:
- Complete [Exercise 3](Exercise 3 Add Feature Service.md), or get the Exercise 3 code solution compiling and running properly, preferably in AppStudio.

If you need some help, you can refer to [the solution to this exercise](../../solutions/Appstudio/Ex4_BufferAndQuery), available in this repository.

## Get the user to click a point

You can use ArcGIS Runtime to detect when and where the user interacts with the map, either with the mouse or with a touchscreen. In this exercise, you just need the user to click or tap a point. You could detect every user click, but instead, we will let the user activate and deactivate this capability with a button.

1. We will add a new button to the UI using [one of the images in the repo](../../images/location.png).  Add the following code below:

    ```
        Column{
            id: controls
            spacing: 10
            anchors {
                left: parent.left
                verticalCenter: parent.verticalCenter
                margins: 10
            }

            Button {
                id: bufferqueryButton
                enabled: true
                Image {
                        anchors.fill: parent
                        source: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garys-esri/geodev-dc-labs/master/2016-11-runtime/images/location.png"
                        fillMode: Image.PreserveAspectFit
                }

                checkable: true
                width: 30
                height: 30
                checked: false
                onPressedChanged: {
                    

                }

            }
        }
    ```
    
1. Next we need to add a GraphicsOverlay to add the graphics to the map.  :

    ```
   GraphicsOverlay{
            id: startGraphics
            renderer: SimpleRenderer {
                SimpleMarkerSymbol {
                    style: Enums.SimpleMarkerSymbolStyleSquare
                    size: 10
                    color: "green"
                }
            }
        }
        

    ```
      

    
1. Next let's create the graphic for the buffer that is created:

    ```
    Graphic {
            id: bufferGraphic
            symbol: SimpleFillSymbol {
                color: Qt.rgba(0.0, 0, 0.5, 0)
                outline:  SimpleLineSymbol {
                    color: "aqua"
                    style: Enums.SimpleLineSymbolStyleSolid
                    width: 2
                }
            }
        }
    ```
    
1. Next let's add the metro stops feature service to query when we do the buffer

    ```
       FeatureLayer {
               id: metrostopsLayer
               visible: false
               ServiceFeatureTable {
                   url: "http://services.arcgis.com/lA2FZKuu26Fips7U/ArcGIS/rest/services/MetroStops/FeatureServer/0"
               }
           }
    ```
    
1. Now let's add the onMouseClick and create the buffer:

       ```
	    onMouseClicked: {
            startGraphics.graphics.clear();
            metrostopsLayer.clearSelection();
            var graphic = ArcGISRuntimeEnvironment.createObject("Graphic");
            graphic.geometry = mouse.mapPoint;
            graphic.spatialReference = map.spatialReference;
               if (bufferqueryButton.checked) {
                   //console.log(startGraphics.numberOfGraphics);
                   if (startGraphics.graphics.count === 0) {
                       startGraphics.graphics.append(graphic);
                       metrostopsLayer.visible = true;
                       //console.log(graphic.spatialReference);

                       //var bufferPolygon = graphic.geometry.buffer(10000, map.spatialReference.unit);
                       var bufferPolygon = GeometryEngine.buffer(graphic.geometry, 10000)
                       console.log(bufferPolygon);
                       //var graphic1 = ArcGISRuntimeEnvironment.createObject("Graphic");
                       bufferGraphic.geometry = bufferPolygon;
                       startGraphics.graphics.append(bufferGraphic);

                       queryParams.geometry = bufferGraphic.geometry;
                       metrostopsLayer.selectionColor = "aqua";
                       metrostopsLayer.selectFeaturesWithQuery(queryParams,Enums.SelectionModeNew);

                   }
               }
           }
    ```
1.  You will need your queryparameters to be used in the query.
    ```
	QueryParameters {
                id: queryParams
                spatialRelationship: Enums.SpatialRelationshipIntersects
        }
    ```    
1. Compile and run your app. Verify that when you click the button and click on the map you get a point and buffer

    ![Create Buffer](06-buffer.png)



1.  Let's add one last bit of code to clear graphics when the button is pressed again.  You will add this to the code for the button's onPressedChanged:
	```
	if (!checked){
                        startGraphics.graphics.clear();
                        metrostopsLayer.clearSelection();
                    }
    }
    ```	
## How did it go?

If you have trouble, **refer to the solution code**, which is linked near the beginning of this exercise. You can also **submit an issue** in this repo to ask a question or report a problem. If you are participating live with Esri presenters, feel free to **ask a question** of the presenters.

If you completed the exercise, congratulations! You learned how to get a user's input on the map, buffer a point, display graphics on the map, and select features based on a query.
